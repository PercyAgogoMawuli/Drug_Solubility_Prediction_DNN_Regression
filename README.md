# Predicting Aqueous Solubility of compounds using Deep learning

*In this project, a fully connected Deep Neural Network(DNN) model was built to help predict the aqueous solubility of organic compounds.
Predicting the aqueous solubility of drugs is notoriously challenging due to the complex interplay of various physicochemical properties and molecular interactions.*


## Dataset
This model correlates molecular properties with solubility with the use of extensive data obtained from delaney data set (1,144 compounds) [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022286021016902?casa_token=_DdP4cRP5gYAAAAA:RtL685PFQC66cnCyk3H0RICxyHB5r-U4D1kImd6-v6SE7j5DuH-sZ5PTswmG0u3mW5YdxH8b )
